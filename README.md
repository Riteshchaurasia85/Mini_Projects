This repository showcases my hands-on experience in backend development and API integration through small but powerful projects, including:
Currency Converter: Real-time currency exchange rate converter using external API integration.
Weather App: Fetches and displays live weather data for any location.
File Creation Utility: Automates file creation and management in a local environment.
Joke Generator: Generates random jokes fetched from an open API for light-hearted fun.
ToDo App: A simple, command-line based task manager demonstrating CRUD operations.
These projects demonstrate my skills in asynchronous programming, REST API consumption, and command-line interface development using Node.js. 
All projects are designed to enhance problem-solving abilities and provide clean, maintainable code examples.
